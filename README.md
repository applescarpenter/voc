my personal trash vocabulary trainer that I never finished. Found this on my pc and thought it would be fun to continue some time. Especially since I experience my foreign langauge skills deteriorating.

Looked into the code and I need to restructure a bit. Especially the database design. It was not meant for the public and still isn't but some things just hurt to look at.


# Introduction

In this project I combined my desire to improve my language and coding skills. This is a fun project which i never intended to make this big and upload to any git site. 
Therefore many things are not optimal and comments are far from perfect or even existent. 
In this project i use many different tools to get to my destination. This means gathering information with webscraping and api usage and importing it to my Postgresql database. 
I will improve this project and comment on this read me to be able to see clearly my journey with this project.
